description: The following analytic detects when the Microsoft Zero-hour Automatic Purge (ZAP) capability takes action against a user's mailbox. This capability is an enhanced protection feature that retro-actively removes email with known malicious content for user inboxes. Since this is a retroactive capability, there is still a window in which the user may fall victim to the malicious content.
